# The Local AI Architect: A Strategic Production Roadmap for Sovereign Educational Game Design

## 1. Executive Summary: From Vision to Utility

The imperative to transform education is often framed in ideological terms—liberation, empowerment, and revolution. While these ideals drive the "why" of educational reform, they often falter in the "how." The user’s reflection on previous iterations of this project—noting a tendency toward "preachiness"—reveals a critical insight: Ideology does not scale; utility does. To change the world, one must not merely argue for a better future but engineer the tools that make that future the path of least resistance.

This project serves as a production-ready roadmap for "The Local AI Architect." It translates high-level aspirations of "Sovereign Ed-Tech" into a granular, executable strategy. By leveraging local Large Language Models (LLMs) like LM Studio and code-native IDEs (Cursor/Zed), we propose a shift from the "Textbook Trap" of passive consumption to a "Sovereign Sandbox" of active creation.

## 2. Core Modules

### [Module 1: The Local Forge (LM Studio Setup)](./module-1-setup/README.md)
Objective: Configure a private, local AI environment using LM Studio, understanding the functional and ethical implications of "air-gapped" intelligence and localhost servers.

### [Module 2: IDE Integration (Cursor / Zed)](./module-2-logic/README.md)
Objective: Connect the LM Studio local API server to professional AI-Native IDEs like Cursor and Zed, enabling powerful autocompletion and generative code without the cloud.

### [Module 3: The Sandbox Bridge (Building with AI)](./module-3-implementation/README.md)
Objective: Use natural language prompting within your connected IDE to automatically generate, compile, and implement game logic in your engine of choice (Bevy, Roblox).

### [Module 4: The Sovereign Sandbox (Rust/Bevy Engine)](./module-4-demo/README.md)
Objective: Build a dedicated, high-performance educational game engine using **Rust** and **Bevy**. This "Sovereign Sandbox" removes reliance on proprietary platforms like Roblox, offering a truly open-source, local-first environment for 3D logic visualization.

## 3. Expanded Vision: Hybrid Media Strategy
To truly scale "The Local AI Architect," we are integrating a multi-modal learning approach:
-   **NotebookLM Video Synthesizer**: utilizing Google's NotebookLM to generate "Deep Dive" audio/video summaries of complex technical concepts.
-   **Human-in-the-Loop (OBS)**: High-fidelity screen captures and commentary from the lead architect (User), grounding the AI theory in human practice.
-   **The Sovereign Sandbox**: A browser-based (WASM) or native Rust/Bevy application that serves as the final "exam" environment for students.

## 4. The Philosophy of Sovereignty

"Sovereign Computing"—running the AI locally on the device—re-establishes the classroom as a "walled garden" of safety. It creates a "Safe Failure Space" where learners can experiment with code, ask "stupid" questions, and explore controversial topics without generating a permanent digital footprint on a corporate server.
