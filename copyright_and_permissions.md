# Copyright and Permissions Statement

**Project:** The Local AI Architect: Building Educational Sandboxes Without Code
**Author:** Joshua Atkinson
**Course:** EDCI 56900-001-005 DIS - Merge
**Date:** February 2026

This document serves as the formal copyright and permissions declaration for all visual, audio, software, and branding assets utilized within the "Local AI Architect" e-learning module and the accompanying "Sovereign Sandbox" demonstration game.

## 1. Visual Assets (Images & Textures)

All 2D textures and visual assets utilized within the Bevy game engine demo (`forge-web/index.html` and the Rust source code) were generated using Artificial Intelligence image generation tools.

* `assets/floor.jpg`
* `assets/wall.jpg`
* `assets/player.jpg`
* `assets/player_walk_2.jpg`
* `assets/teacher.jpg`

**Permission Status:** These images were generated specifically for this educational project. Under current US Copyright Office guidelines regarding AI-generated imagery, these assets exist in the public domain and/or are free for commercial and educational use without requirement for external attribution or royalty payments.

## 2. Audio Assets

* `assets/jfk.wav`

**Permission Status:** This audio file consists of historical, public domain speech audio (President John F. Kennedy) processed for educational demonstration within the sandbox environment. As a work of the United States federal government/historical public address, the underlying speech is in the public domain.

## 3. Software, Engines, and Libraries

The module heavily relies on open-source frameworks. No proprietary, closed-source educational software (such as standard vendor-locked LMS platforms) was used, aligning with the "Sovereign Ed-Tech" pedagogical goal.

* **Bevy Engine:** The game demonstration is built using Bevy, a data-driven game engine built in Rust.
  * **License:** Dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0. Free for commercial and educational use.
