This document serves as the formal copyright and permissions declaration for all visual, audio, software, and branding assets utilized within the "Local AI Architect" e-learning module and the accompanying "Sovereign Sandbox" demonstration game.

## 1. Visual Assets (Images & Textures)

All 2D textures and visual assets utilized within the Bevy game engine demo (`forge-web/index.html` and the Rust source code) were generated using Artificial Intelligence image generation tools.

## 3. Software, Engines, and Libraries

The module heavily relies on open-source frameworks. No proprietary, closed-source educational software (such as standard vendor-locked LMS platforms) was used, aligning with the "Sovereign Ed-Tech" pedagogical goal.
