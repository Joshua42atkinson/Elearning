# Pedagogical Framework: The Sovereign Architect

This project follows a strict instructional design philosophy to ensure "Utility over Ideology."

## 1. Governance & Constraints

### The "Air-Gap" Mandate
- **Data Sovereignty**: NO student data shall be sent to external APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic). All inference must be local (Ollama).
- **Safe Failure Space**: The environment must encourage experimentation. Errors are "glitches in the simulation," not failures of the student.

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Syntax vs. Semantics**: The AI handles the syntax (code generation). The student focuses on the semantics (logic/intent).
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Do not teach a command until the user has a problem that requires it.

## 2. Gagné’s Nine Events (Agentic Implementation)

| Event | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gain Attention** | "Boot Sequence" visuals, narrative hooks ("Rent vs. Own"). |
| **Inform Objectives** | "Tech Tree" visualization, clear mission goals. |
| **Stimulate Recall** | "If/Then" analogies to classroom rules. |
| **Present Material** | "One-Click" logic demonstrations, "Show, Don't Tell". |
| **Provide Guidance** | "Prompt Recipe Cards" as scaffolding. |
| **Elicit Performance** | "Vibe Coding" sessions (loops of intent -> code -> critique). |
| **Provide Feedback** | "Status Green" terminal outputs, immediate game engine results. |
| **Assess Performance** | "Runtime Repairman" scenarios (fixing broken systems). |
| **Enhance Transfer** | Cross-disciplinary examples (History simulations, Biology models). |

## 3. Constructionism 2.0
- **The Artifact**: Learning must result in a public entity (a game, a simulation).
- **The Prosthetic**: The Local AI is a "More Knowledgeable Other" (Vygotsky) that bridges the gap between intent and execution.
