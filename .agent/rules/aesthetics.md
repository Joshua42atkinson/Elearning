# Project Aesthetics: "Daydream Matrix-Rust"

All UI components, whether Web or Rust/Bevy, must adhere to this design system.

## Color Palette
| Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phosphor Amber** | `#FFBF00` | Primary Text, Active States, "The Dream" |
| **Phosphor Dim** | `#B38600` | Borders, Secondary Text |
| **Industrial Rust** | `#B7410E` | Alerts, Warnings, "The Grime", Air-Gap |
| **Deep Charcoal** | `#1A1A1A` | Backgrounds, Panels |
| **Terminal Black** | `#0D0D0D` | Input Fields, Console Backgrounds |
| **Status Green** | `#40FF00` | Success, Verified, "Safe" |

## Typography
-   **Headers**: Monospace/Block (e.g., VT323, JetBrains Mono)
-   **Body**: Clean Sans-serif (Inter/Roboto) for readability, Monospace for code.

## UI Principles
1.  **High Density**: Interfaces should look like "Workbenches," not marketing pages. Information density is high.
2.  **Sovereign Feel**: Use "Scanlines," "Grid Backgrounds," and "Terminal" motifs to reinforce the local/hacker aesthetic.
3.  **Feedback**: Every action has immediate visual feedback (e.g., text typing effects, glowing borders).
