# **Assignment: E-Learning Storyboard**

**Student:** Joshua Atkinson

**Course:** EDCI 56900-001-005 – Creating Storyboards

**Date:** January 27, 2026

**Project:** The Local AI Architect

## **Part 1: The Instructional Video Series**

### **Video 1: Starting Your Private Assistant (The Setup)**

**Focus:** Simple steps to own your AI tools locally.

**Tone:** Calm, helpful, and straightforward.

| Scene | Visual / Screen Capture | Audio / Script | Instructional Event |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **01: The Goal** | A clear view of a student engaged in a game vs. a static worksheet. | "We all want our students to be active participants in their learning, not just passive readers. Today, we’re going to set up a private assistant that helps you build those active experiences right from your own computer." | **Gain Attention** |
| **02: The Tool** | Browser showing the Ollama homepage. A simple click on "Download." | "Our first step is to bring the tool home. We’re using a program called Ollama. It’s a simple, free download that acts as the engine for everything we’re about to build." | **Inform Objective** |
| **03: The First Step** | Open a terminal window. Type: ollama run llama3. | "Once it's installed, we give it one instruction to get started. You'll see a progress bar. While this moves, the computer is preparing its own internal 'brain' that belongs only to you." | **Stimulate Recall** |
| **04: The Result** | The Wi-Fi is turned off. A prompt is typed: "How can I explain a circuit to a child?" | "Now, look at this. Even with the internet turned off, your assistant is ready to help. This means your ideas and your students' data never leave your sight. It's safe, it's private, and it's yours." | **Present Stimulus** |
| **05: Looking Ahead** | Transition to a blank document titled "Lesson Ideas." | "Now that your assistant is ready, we can start a conversation about how to turn your next lesson into an interactive world." | **Enhance Retention** |

### **Video 2: Translating Ideas into Rules (The Logic)**

**Focus:** Using natural language to create game behaviors.

**Tone:** Collaborative and practical.

| Scene | Visual / Screen Capture | Audio / Script | Instructional Event |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **01: The Concept** | A simple lesson plan on the screen about 'Ecosystems.' | "You already have great lesson plans. Usually, these stay on paper. But what if we could turn these ideas into rules for a digital world?" | **Stimulate Recall** |
| **02: The Prompt** | Typing into the AI: "I'm teaching about ecosystems. Can you help me write a set of rules for a character in a game that explains how bees help flowers?" | "We don't need to learn a new programming language. We just need to talk to our assistant. We explain what we want to happen, and it helps us organize those thoughts into logic." | **Learning Guidance** |
| **03: The Draft** | The AI provides a clear list of 'If/Then' statements. | "See how the assistant responded? It took your lesson and turned it into a clear set of steps: If a bee visits a flower, then the flower can grow. This is the bridge between your imagination and a playable game." | **Present Stimulus** |
| **04: Refinement** | Adding a detail: "Make the character say 'Thank you' when the player helps." | "If it's not quite right, we just ask for a change. It’s a simple back-and-forth until the logic matches exactly how you want your students to learn." | **Elicit Performance** |
| **05: The Handoff** | Copying the text from the AI window. | "With our rules written down in plain language, we’re ready to put them into a space where students can actually play with them." | **Provide Feedback** |

### **Video 3: Bringing the World to Life (Implementation)**

**Focus:** Moving logic into interactive spaces like Roblox or Minecraft.

**Tone:** Clear, successful, and empowering.

| Scene | Visual / Screen Capture | Audio / Script | Instructional Event |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **01: The Space** | A basic, colorful world in a game engine (like Roblox Studio). | "This is our digital classroom. It’s a place where students can explore. Right now, it's just a world, but we’re about to give it a purpose." | **Present Stimulus** |
| **02: The Action** | Pasting the AI-generated logic into a simple script box. | "We take the rules we just wrote with our assistant and place them into a character. Because our assistant did the technical translation, we can stay focused on the teaching." | **Learning Guidance** |
| **03: The Play** | A player walks up to the character; the interaction works as planned. | "Now, the lesson is alive. When a student interacts with this world, they aren't just reading about a concept—they are experiencing it. Your lesson plan has become an interaction." | **Assess Performance** |
| **04: The Impact** | Showing a variety of simple examples (History, Math, Science). | "The technical barrier has disappeared. If you can describe a learning experience, you can build it. You are now creating the tools your students need to thrive." | **Enhance Transfer** |

## **Part 2: The Learning Sandbox (Game Storyboard)**

**Environment:** A clean, accessible 3D demonstration area.

* **Level 1: The Introduction**  
  * **Goal:** Orient the player.  
  * **Activity:** Walk through a space where characters explain how they were built using simple, natural language rules.  
* **Level 2: The Choice Room**  
  * **Goal:** Demonstrate flexibility.  
  * **Activity:** The player chooses between different "Rule Sets" (e.g., a "Scientific Rule" or a "Historical Rule"). They watch the NPCs change their behavior based on the selected text.  
* **Level 3: The Knowledge Gate**  
  * **Goal:** Assessment.  
  * **Activity:** The player describes a simple behavior they want to see, and the game simulates it using the built-in logic engine.

## **Part 3: The Interaction Blueprint (Guide)**

**The Simple Guide for Educators:**

1. **Describe the Goal:** "I want my students to understand \[Topic\]."  
2. **Define the Interaction:** "When the player does \[Action\], the world should \[Result\]."  
3. **Ask for Translation:** "Help me turn this into a step-by-step logic set for a game character."

## **Part 4: ID Reflection**

**How does learning about this topic apply to your future professional plans?**

**Response:**

Learning to storyboard complex technical processes using simple, natural language is a core skill for my professional growth. It allows me to bridge the gap between advanced technology—like local AI and game engines—and the practical needs of educators. By removing technical jargon and "ego-driven" terminology, I can empower teachers to feel capable and in control of their own digital tools. This project proves that effective instructional design isn't about the complexity of the machine, but the clarity of the instruction, which is a principle I will carry forward into all my future educational work.
