| Project Title: | The Local AI Architect: Building Educational Sandboxes Without Code |
| :---- | :---- |
| Project Description: | This project is a multi-part eLearning experience delivered through a YouTube instructional collection and a playable Rust (Bevy) demonstration game. It teaches educators and homeschool parents how to use local AI (Ollama) as a bridge between their teaching ideas and functional game environments. By using natural language as the interface, learners create interactive learning spaces in Minecraft and Roblox without needing to write traditional code. |
| Gap Analysis: | **Current or Actual Status:** Educators often rely on "closed" software that limits students to passive consumption. While teachers have creative ideas for interactive learning, they are often stopped by the "technical wall" of coding. Additionally, the cost and privacy risks of cloud-based AI tools prevent many schools from adopting these technologies. **Desired Status:** Educators function as "Experience Architects." They use local AI to translate their teaching goals into game logic in real-time. The focus shifts from "how to code" to "what to build," with the AI serving as a practical assistant for technical tasks. **Need or Desired Status:** There is a need for a "Local-First" workflow that allows individual creators to build high-quality educational games with the same level of effort usually spent on a static lesson plan, while keeping all data private on their own hardware. |

 

**Stakeholders and Their Roles and Responsibilities**  
(List people and their role(s) and responsibilities for the project. Do not include EDCI 569 instructors.)

| Learning Designer: | Joshua Mark Atkinson Responsibility: Leading the narrative and technical design. I am responsible for structuring the instructional path, managing the AI setup, and developing the Bevy-based demonstration game. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Critical Project Stakeholders: | 1\. **K-12 Educators:** Teachers looking to replace static materials with interactive, creative sandboxes. 2\. **Home-School Parents:** Parents building private, collaborative environments that focus on active play and social learning. |
| Subject Matter Experts (person or resource): | 1\. **Technical Resource:** Focuses on local AI setup, model selection, and hardware optimization.  2\. **Pedagogical Resource:** Focuses on Constructionist learning (learning by building) and student motivation. |
| Other Contributors: | **The Open Source Community**, providing the essential tools such as Bevy, Ollama, and open-source AI models.  |
| Communication: | Updates and collaboration will happen via the **YouTube Community tab** |

 

**Learner Analysis**

| Target Audience: | Non-technical K-12 teachers, librarians, and home-school parents who want to use technology as a tool for student expression. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Unique Characteristics of Learners: | These learners have a high creative drive but little interest in technical gatekeeping. They are "time-poor" and operate in high-pressure environments. They value student privacy and prefer learning through clear metaphors and "proof of work" rather than abstract data. |
| Research / Theory / Model Selected in Response to Learners’ Needs: | **Constructionism (Papert):** We don't just talk about AI; we build with it. Learning happens through the act of creating a sandbox. **Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller):** We use AI to handle the coding syntax (extraneous load), allowing the educator to focus on the teaching design (germane load). **Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan):** We focus on **Autonomy**. Local tools give educators control over their own digital environment without corporate subscriptions. |

   
**Project Content**

| Project Goal: | To guide educators in mastering a "Source, Forge, Build" workflow that turns natural language intent into a playable learning environment. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Learning Objectives: | After completing this module, learners will be able to: **Configure** a private local AI (Ollama) to ensure student data remains on their own hardware. **Orchestrate** a "Mentor-in-the-Loop" interaction by using natural language to create logic for a game character (NPC). **Implement** these rules into a sandbox like Minecraft or Roblox, turning a static world into an interactive playground. |
| Description of Engagement Strategies/ Interaction | Using **Gagné’s Nine Events** as the framework: **Gain Attention:** The "Speed-Run"—a short sequence showing a single paragraph of text becoming a playable game environment. **Present Stimulus:** The "Side-by-Side"—a demonstration showing the teacher's intent on one side and the resulting logic on the other. **Elicit Performance:** The "Logic Sort"—an exercise where learners identify prompts that create helpful student scaffolding versus those that just output text. |
| Assessment Plan: | **Formative:** A downloadable checklist for learners to test and refine their AI prompts. **Summative:** Interaction with the Bevy demo at **consciousframework.com**, followed by a reflection on the effort-to-result ratio of this workflow compared to traditional methods. |
| Content Outline (brief): | 1\. **The Local Forge:** Why "Local-First" matters; setting up the AI; protecting privacy. 2\. **Intent to Action:** Writing effective prompts; turning ideas into iterative logic.  3\. **The Sandbox Bridge:** Moving from AI to the game; Minecraft implementation; the future of Bevy. |

**Course Deliverables**

| Platform(s) or Authoring Tool(s) to be Used: |  YouTube: For the "chunked" video series. consciousframework.com: Hosting the playable Bevy game demo. OBS Studio: For clear, high-quality screen demonstrations. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Description of Deliverables / Course Assets (All items to be created and delivered to create the final module): | 1\. **The Instructional Trilogy:** Three 5–7 minute videos focused on setup, logic, and building.  2\. **Interactive Sandbox Demo:** A playable proof-of-concept showing what is possible with this workflow.  3\. **The Prompt Blueprint:** A simple PDF guide with "recipes" for effective educational prompting. 4\. **Copyright Manifest:** A document detailing the open-source foundations of the project. |

**ID Reflection**

| How does learning about this topic apply to your future professional plans? |  I am exploring how Instructional Design can thrive through "Sovereign Computing." My background in narrative helps me see "coding" as a form of storytelling. By putting the tools of creation directly into the hands of teachers, I hope to help build a future where technology is accessible, private, and driven by the educator's imagination rather than corporate software constraints. |
