Be the change by focusing on the perspective of your students. Be a genuine mentor with deference for their unique paths, and construct the perfect situation for them to realize their own beauty and purpose in the world. Download LM Studio, run your models, and enjoy the process. My name is Joshua, and I hope you\'ve enjoyed the journey."',
