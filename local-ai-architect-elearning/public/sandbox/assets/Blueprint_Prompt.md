# Handout Generation Prompt

Copy and paste the following prompt into your favorite AI text generator (like Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT) to generate the content for your PDF handout.

***

**System Role:** You are an expert instructional designer, game developer, and AI educator. You specialize in translating complex technical concepts into inspiring, actionable guides for educators and creators.

**Objective:** Write the comprehensive content for a multi-page PDF handout titled "The Natural Language Blueprint: Shaping Architectures with COSTAR." The goal of this handout is to help people "imagine new possibilities with gamifying education" using local AI and game engines (like Bevy and Roblox). 

**Context:** This handout is the final deliverable for the "Local AI Architect" e-learning module. The module teaches users how to set up local AI (using Ollama), integrate it with Cursor/Zed IDEs for scaffolding, and finally deploy the AI logic into a WASM Bevy game called the "Sovereign Sandbox."

**Target Audience:** Educators, instructional designers, and hobbyist game developers who want to use AI to build interactive, gamified learning experiences without needing deep programming expertise.

**Required Sections:**

1. **The Vision (Introduction):** Start with an inspiring hook about moving from "consuming" education to "architecting" it. Explain how natural language is the new educational coding language.
2. **The COSTAR Framework:** Explain the methodology we use for prompting local AI. Break down the acronym:
   * **C**ontext
   * **O**bjective
   * **S**tyle
   * **T**one
   * **A**udience
   * **R**esponse
3. **Use Case 1: The Socratic AI NPC:** Provide a robust, copy-pasteable COSTAR prompt for creating a non-player character that acts as a mentor in a virtual world. Explain how this changes the dynamic of multiple-choice tests into organic dialogue.
4. **Use Case 2: Generating Game Logic (Rust/Bevy):** Provide another COSTAR prompt that shows the AI generating a specific Bevy ESC system (like spawning a collectible "Knowledge Fragment"). Explain how AI acts as dynamic scaffolding in their IDE to reduce the barrier of entry to game dev.
5. **The Sovereign Sandbox Principles:** Conclude with 3-4 core design principles on how to design "Educational Sandboxes." Focus on intrinsic motivation, Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, and the power of local/private AI.

**Tone & Style:** Professional, visionary, slightly cyberpunk ("Neon Wizard" aesthetic), and deeply pedagogical. Use formatting (bolding, blockquotes, bullets) to make it highly skimmable and visually appealing for a PDF layout.
